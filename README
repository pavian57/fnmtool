I. Introduction
===============

fnmtool was designed to be compatible NetMgr-Clone for Linux. The current
version is somewhere around 1.0

II. Config file
===============

fnmtool uses the same config-format as Netmgr. Refer to Netmgr documentation for
details.

III. Portability Issues
=======================

The code is written almost exclusively using ANSI C++, so it shouldn't be too
hard to port it to any system which has a C++ compiler conforming to ANSI.

IV. additional Features
=======================

following Actions have been added:
			pingpong:	a function, that answers a request to a PING received by fidonet mail. 
			email:	scans your fidonet netmail and sends the mail to your whatever mail account with smtp. so you can read your netmail on your smartphone

With fnmrfc2ftn, you may send mail back from your email acount to fidonet.
May only work if you have your own mailsystem running, tested with postfix.
